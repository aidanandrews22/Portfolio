    image: "/assets/Book/book1.jpg",
    description:
      "Exploring what it means to be successful in a world that rewards hard work and luck. Gladwell discusses the factors that contribute to a high-level of success. Gladwell proposes that personal achievements are not solely caused by an individual traits such as hard-work and intelligence. Rather, success is often molded by external factors such as family, culture, and idiosyncratic opportunities that individuals encounter by chance. One thing that stuck with me from this book was the 10,000 hour rule, Gladwell claims that to achieve word-class expertise in any field an individual must spend around 10,000 hours on their skills. However, he also mentions that external factors such as timing, culture, upbringing, and even birthdates significantly affect an individuals success potential.",
